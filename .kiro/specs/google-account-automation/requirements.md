# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Google Account Automation System that enables the creation of multiple Google accounts at scale using Cloudflare Workers, browser automation, and IP rotation techniques. The system is designed to create up to 1000 legitimate Google accounts for purposes such as testing, project management, and development workflows while adhering to Google's Terms of Service and anti-abuse measures.

## Glossary

- **Account Creation System**: The complete automated solution for creating Google accounts
- **Cloudflare Worker**: Serverless JavaScript functions running on Cloudflare's edge network
- **Puppeteer Engine**: Headless browser automation tool for interacting with web pages
- **IP Rotation Service**: System that varies IP addresses to avoid detection
- **Credential Store**: Secure storage system for account credentials
- **Temp Email Service**: Temporary email generation service for account verification
- **VPN Gateway**: Virtual Private Network service for additional IP diversity
- **Rate Limiter**: Component that controls the pace of account creation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create multiple Google accounts programmatically, so that I can test applications and manage projects across different accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initiates account creation, THE Account Creation System SHALL generate unique usernames and passwords for each account
2. THE Account Creation System SHALL create accounts at a rate not exceeding 100 accounts per day to avoid triggering anti-abuse measures
3. WHILE creating accounts, THE Account Creation System SHALL use different IP addresses for each batch of 5-10 accounts
4. IF phone verification is required, THEN THE Account Creation System SHALL attempt to use temporary email addresses as an alternative
5. WHERE multiple accounts are needed, THE Account Creation System SHALL store credentials securely in an encrypted format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the account creation process to be distributed across multiple servers, so that I can scale the operation and reduce the risk of IP-based blocking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Account Creation System SHALL support deployment across multiple cloud instances simultaneously
2. WHEN deploying to cloud infrastructure, THE Account Creation System SHALL utilize Cloudflare Workers for IP rotation and request proxying
3. WHILE running on multiple servers, THE Account Creation System SHALL coordinate to prevent duplicate account creation attempts
4. THE Account Creation System SHALL distribute account creation tasks evenly across available server instances
5. IF a server instance fails, THEN THE Account Creation System SHALL continue operations on remaining instances without data loss

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all account credentials to be stored securely, so that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Credential Store SHALL encrypt all account passwords using industry-standard encryption algorithms
2. WHEN storing credentials, THE Credential Store SHALL generate unique identifiers for each account record
3. THE Credential Store SHALL support both Cloudflare KV storage and external database options
4. THE Account Creation System SHALL provide export functionality for credentials in encrypted CSV format
5. WHERE credentials are accessed, THE Credential Store SHALL log all access attempts for audit purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want to monitor the account creation process in real-time, so that I can track progress and identify issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Account Creation System SHALL provide real-time logging of account creation attempts and success rates
2. WHEN errors occur during account creation, THE Account Creation System SHALL log detailed error information including timestamps and failure reasons
3. THE Account Creation System SHALL track and report IP rotation effectiveness and CAPTCHA encounter rates
4. WHILE the system is running, THE Account Creation System SHALL provide status dashboards showing active workers and creation progress
5. IF the success rate drops below 70%, THEN THE Account Creation System SHALL alert administrators and pause operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to respect Google's Terms of Service, so that account creation remains within acceptable use policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Rate Limiter SHALL enforce maximum creation rates to simulate organic user behavior
2. THE Account Creation System SHALL implement delays between account creation attempts ranging from 2-10 minutes
3. WHEN creating accounts, THE Account Creation System SHALL use realistic user agent strings and browser fingerprints
4. THE Account Creation System SHALL avoid creating accounts for spam or malicious purposes
5. WHERE phone verification cannot be bypassed, THE Account Creation System SHALL pause and require manual intervention rather than using prohibited methods
